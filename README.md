# Research-Papers
Hi there!\
I intend to keep updating this repository with papers I find insightful and the ones which align with my research interests (computational social science, mental well being, marginalized communities and social computing)!

I have split them up into different folders based on the approach they use:
- [Quantitaive](https://github.com/epicalyx/Research-Papers/tree/master/Quantitative) 
- [Qualitative](https://github.com/epicalyx/Research-Papers/tree/master/Qualitative)
- [Mixed Methods](https://github.com/epicalyx/Research-Papers/tree/master/Mixed%20Methods)

### Reading List
| Paper | Tags | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| []() | Mental Well Being | Done |


Just in case you are looking for a way to manage your reading list properly, do check [this](https://github.com/wuningxi/Talks/blob/main/2020_How_to_be_organised_and_productive_during_your_PhD.pdf) out. It is absolutely amazing!
