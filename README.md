# Research-Papers
Hi there!\
I intend to keep updating this repository with papers I find insightful and the ones which align with my research interests (computational social science, mental well being, marginalized communities and social computing)!

I have split them up into different folders based on the approach they use:
- [Quantitaive](https://github.com/epicalyx/Research-Papers/tree/master/Quantitative) 
- [Qualitative](https://github.com/epicalyx/Research-Papers/tree/master/Qualitative)
- [Mixed Methods](https://github.com/epicalyx/Research-Papers/tree/master/Mixed%20Methods)

### Reading List
